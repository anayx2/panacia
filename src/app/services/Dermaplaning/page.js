                            At Panacea Health & Beauty Clinic, we offer the highly effective and sought-after dermaplaning treatment, a non-invasive procedure that exfoliates and rejuvenates the skin, leaving you with a smooth, radiant complexion. This treatment is perfect for anyone looking to enhance their skin’s appearance, remove dead skin cells, and create a flawless canvas for makeup application. With dermaplaning, you’ll achieve a glowing, youthful complexion in no time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Dermaplaning is a gentle exfoliation treatment that uses a surgical-grade scalpel to carefully remove dead skin cells and fine vellus hair (commonly known as peach fuzz) from the surface of the skin. This process reveals a smoother, brighter, and more even skin texture. By removing the build-up of dead skin cells and hair, dermaplaning treatment helps to improve the skin’s ability to absorb skincare products and allows for a more flawless application of makeup.

                        <p className=" leading-relaxed">
                            After your dermaplaning treatment, your skin will immediately feel softer, smoother, and more luminous. There is no downtime required, so you can return to your usual activities right away. You may experience some mild redness in the treated area, which typically disappears within a few hours.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To maintain the results, we recommend using sunscreen daily, as the skin may be more sensitive after exfoliation. Additionally, continuing with your regular skincare routine will help enhance the treatment’s effects.

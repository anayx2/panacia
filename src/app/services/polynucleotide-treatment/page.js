                                The procedure involves the injection of polynucleotides into the targeted areas. For skin rejuvenation, this might include areas such as the face, neck, or décolletage. For hair restoration, polynucleotides are injected into the scalp to stimulate hair follicle activity.                            </p>

                                Once injected, the polynucleotides promote tissue regeneration by stimulating collagen and elastin production, improving hydration, and revitalizing skin or hair follicles. The natural healing response of your body takes over, delivering long-lasting improvements.

                                Once your PRP is prepared, it is carefully injected into the targeted areas of your skin or scalp. For skin rejuvenation, the PRP is injected into the face, neck, or décolletage to boost collagen and skin texture. For hair restoration, PRP is injected into the scalp to encourage hair follicle regeneration and promote thicker hair growth.                            </p>

                                There is minimal downtime associated with Polynucleotide Treatment. You may experience mild redness or swelling in the treated areas, but this is temporary. Results typically begin to appear within 2 to 3 weeks, with optimal outcomes becoming visible over the following months as your skin or hair continues to regenerate..                           </p>

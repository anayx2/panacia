        question: "Does PRP actually regrow hair?",
        answer: "PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma) can stimulate hair growth and improve hair thickness, but results vary, and it's most effective in the early stages of hair loss."
    },
    {
        question: "Who should not do PRP treatment?",
        answer: "PRP should be avoided by individuals with blood disorders, active infections, or certain scalp conditions like alopecia areata or severe anaemia."
    },
    {
        question: "Is PRP very painful?",
        answer: "PRP is generally not very painful, but discomfort can occur during the injection process. Numbing cream is often applied to reduce pain."
    },
    {
        question: "Why is PRP so expensive?",
        answer: "PRP is costly due to the specialised process of extracting and preparing the plasma, as well as the need for multiple sessions and skilled practitioners."
    },
    {
        question: "Does PRP have bad side effects?",
        answer: "PRP is generally safe with minimal side effects, but possible reactions include swelling, redness, or irritation at the injection site."
    },
    {
        question: "Is PRP safe for hair?",
        answer: "PRP is considered safe for hair regrowth, as it uses your own blood, reducing the risk of allergic reactions or infections."
    },
    {
        question: "What happens if PRP goes wrong?",
        answer: "If PRP treatment goes wrong, complications like infection, scarring, or no improvement in hair growth can occur. Choosing a skilled practitioner reduces these risks."

                            What to Expect During Your Hopi Ear Candle Treatment </h2>
                        <p className=" leading-relaxed">
                            When you visit Panacea Health & Beauty Clinic for a Hopi ear candle session, our experienced therapist will start by carefully explaining the process and ensuring you are comfortable. You will be asked to lie on your side while the candle is placed at the entrance of the ear.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As the candle burns, you will feel a gentle warmth and hear a soothing crackling sound. The treatment usually lasts between 20 to 30 minutes, depending on your needs. After the treatment, your therapist may gently clean the outer ear to remove any excess wax that has been loosened during the process.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While the process is relaxing, you may also experience relief from symptoms such as ear pressure or sinus discomfort immediately following the treatment. Most clients feel refreshed and at ease after their session, with many returning regularly for maintenance.

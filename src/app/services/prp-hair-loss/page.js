        question: "Does PRP actually regrow hair?",
        answer: "PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma) can stimulate hair growth and improve hair thickness, but results vary, and it's most effective in the early stages of hair loss."
    },
    {
        question: "Who should not do PRP treatment?",
        answer: "PRP should be avoided by individuals with blood disorders, active infections, or certain scalp conditions like alopecia areata or severe anaemia."
    },
    {
        question: "Is PRP very painful?",
        answer: "PRP is generally not very painful, but discomfort can occur during the injection process. Numbing cream is often applied to reduce pain."
    },
    {
        question: "Why is PRP so expensive?",
        answer: "PRP is costly due to the specialised process of extracting and preparing the plasma, as well as the need for multiple sessions and skilled practitioners."
    },
    {
        question: "Does PRP have bad side effects?",
        answer: "PRP is generally safe with minimal side effects, but possible reactions include swelling, redness, or irritation at the injection site."
    },
    {
        question: "Is PRP safe for hair?",
        answer: "PRP is considered safe for hair regrowth, as it uses your own blood, reducing the risk of allergic reactions or infections."
    },
    {
        question: "What happens if PRP goes wrong?",
        answer: "If PRP treatment goes wrong, complications like infection, scarring, or no improvement in hair growth can occur. Choosing a skilled practitioner reduces these risks."

                            At Panacea Health & Beauty Clinic, we offer advanced and effective solutions to address hair thinning and hair loss. One of our most sought-after treatments is PRP hair treatment, a non-surgical, natural therapy designed to stimulate hair growth and restore your hair's health and vitality. Using your body’s own growth factors, PRP treatment for hair loss is a safe, innovative solution that promotes the regrowth of hair without the need for invasive procedures.
                            <br />
                            PRP hair treatment (Platelet-Rich Plasma) involves using your own blood plasma, which is rich in growth factors, to rejuvenate and stimulate hair follicles. The process begins with a small sample of your blood being taken, which is then processed to extract the plasma.

                            How Does PRP Hair Treatment Work? </h2>

                            </span>
                            A small amount of your blood is drawn, typically from your arm, and placed into a centrifuge to separate the plasma from other blood components.

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span className='font-bold pr-1'>

                            The platelet-rich plasma is extracted and prepared for injection. This plasma contains high concentrations of growth factors that encourage tissue repair and regeneration.

                        </li>
                        <li>

                            The PRP treatment for hair loss is then carefully injected into the areas of your scalp where hair thinning or loss has occurred. The growth factors in the plasma stimulate the hair follicles, encouraging hair growth and improving the health of existing hair.

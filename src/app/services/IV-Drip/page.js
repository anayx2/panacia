                            How Does IV Drip Treatment Work? </h2>
                        <p className=" leading-relaxed">
                            At Panacea Health & Beauty Clinic, the IV drip treatment process is simple and straightforward. Upon arrival, you will have a consultation with one of our experienced professionals to discuss your specific health goals and concerns. Based on this, we will customise the treatment to suit your needs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Once your treatment plan is in place, a small needle is gently inserted into a vein in your arm, and the IV drip is slowly administered. The treatment typically lasts between 30 to 60 minutes, during which you can relax in a comfortable environment.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The nutrients in the IV drip are absorbed directly into your bloodstream, allowing for rapid and effective results. Many clients experience noticeable benefits immediately following the session, including improved hydration, increased energy, and a general sense of well-being.

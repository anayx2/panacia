                <p className="text-gray-600">
                    Sitting is incompatible with many of your pup's unwanted behaviors, like jumping up on visitors or counter-surfing. If your dog starts to display these unwanted behaviors, you can put them into the "sit" position and reward them for their good behavior.

                <p className="text-gray-600">
                    Lie down is another command that's easily taught with lure training, and it's a great natural next step from "sit." With your dog in a seated position, hold a treat in front of their nose. Slowly move the treat toward the ground and closer to you, encouraging your dog to follow with their nose. If your dog struggles to get all the way down, try pulling the treat further away from their body.
